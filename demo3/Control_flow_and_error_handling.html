		Block statement
	/**
	JavaScript prior to ECMAScript 6 does not have block scope. Variables introduced within a block are scoped to the containing function or script, and the effects of setting them persist beyond the block itself. In other words, block statements do not define a scope. "Standalone" blocks in JavaScript can produce completely different results from what they would produce in C or Java. For example:
	**/
	var x = 1;
	{
	  var x = 2;
	}
	console.log(x);
