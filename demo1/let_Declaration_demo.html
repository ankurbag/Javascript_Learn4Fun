		JavaScript before ECMAScript 6 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

		This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 6.
